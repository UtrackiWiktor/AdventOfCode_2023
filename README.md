My solutions to AoC 2023

## Intro
I'm not sure yet if I'm commited to the AoC, first task seemed quite fun so I did it and then I did day 2 and 3. Now I'm on day 4 and the tasks are really quite fun to do so maybe I'll try to do all of them?

## About the solutions
I'm posting only the code of my solution and the input data, no IDE configuration or anything like this. 

On day-to-day basis / professionally I use PHP and Java but it's been some time since I used C\C++ or C# and the C family holds a special place in my heart so that's why im using it to solve the tasks. (I might use some other languages in the future tho)

Solutions are not well-optimized but produce good results and as Donald Knuth said "Premature optimization is the root of all evil". Im not try-harding them, its just a bit of fun on the side.
